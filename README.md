## Introduction
This technical report centers around the creation of a 2D platformer internally titled PixelPlatformer. It focuses on the finalized and in-progress features of the PixelPlatformer game developed on the Godot Engine development environment in tandem with GDScript, Godot’s in-house programming language. Additionally, the game’s core focus on educating users on basic programming logic and its implementation into the 2D platformer’s level design is also detailed in the report. 

## The problem/application
We plan to make an application with the goal of teaching users how to code by providing a foundation in logic. This will be done through movement commands in a terminal. 
The game will include tile mapping and the character’s animations made with a sprite sheet. The character the user will control is a small robot.

## Style & Story
The overall style of the game will be pixelated and have a storyline beyond the specific levels. As of right now, we plan to make 3 levels. The storyline will loosely be based off of the robot’s  character escaping his old life(e.g. industrial background) and as the level progresses the background becomes more and more organic(e.g. cave and forest backgrounds).

## Audio  
This project will primarily use the .mp3 file format to store its audio. The game will feature a looping song to function as a background track, with a unique song featured in each level. Each of the differing areas will have a background track that corresponds with the environment. Additionally, most motions made by the player controlled character, such as jumping or moving left, will also have sound effects. When jumping, a thruster sound is made.

## How its done?
The application will be developed on the Godot Engine development environment in tandem with GDScript, Godot’s in-house programming language. We chose this environment for our project to explore its ease of use in terms of gaming development. None of the project contributors have worked with Godot Engine before, it will be a new experience for us.
